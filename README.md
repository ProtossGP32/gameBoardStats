This is a simple web application that manages users, board games and gameplays, either by accessing a Thymeleaf admin frontend, via a React frontend (only plain users) or via API requests.

Some of its features:
- Users can add games to its collection and add other users and friends
- Admin can apply CRUD operations to:
  - Board games
  - Users
  - Gameplays

TODO:
- Access all API features from a React application
- Secure access to backend

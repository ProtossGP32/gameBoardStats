# Introduction

After the first UML desing, the developement of our java application started. 

:::{.callout-warning}
## TODO: Write an introduction to this entry
:::

## User

User class has been built using lombok annotations. Has been given a Entity annotation. Also, all the annotations needed to store the object in a SQL DB has been used.

During the developement we have encountered a problem with the JSON serialization and deserialization with the friend parameter. That's why we have found a simple solution to keep building our application. At this point, we are filtering that only returns the friends list with one level of depth.

```{.java include=../../tindergames/src/main/java/org/teamcifo/tindergames/userEntity/User.java}

```

## BoardGame

BoardGame class with Lombok, JPA an JSON annotations used.

```{.java include=../../tindergames/src/main/java/org/teamcifo/tindergames/boardGameEntity/BoardGame.java}

```

## GameStats

This class will be used to record statistics from the games played by the user. More features and developement will be done

```{.java include=../../tindergames/src/main/java/org/teamcifo/tindergames/gamesCollectionEntity/GameStats.java}

```

## Gameplay

Gameplay is the class that will manage the plays that user's can publish and record in our service. 

Still under developement

```{.java include=../../tindergames/src/main/java/org/teamcifo/tindergames/gamePlayEntity/Gameplay.java}

```
